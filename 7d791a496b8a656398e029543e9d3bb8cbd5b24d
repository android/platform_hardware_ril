      "message": "When it was defined as CDMA, and GSM/UMTS those were the only technologies that were supported. But now CDMA is not just CDMA, CDMA could also mean EVDO. GSM/UMTS could mean HSPA as well. In the future we will support LTE as well. With LTE, we will be supporting CDMA+LTE handsets. So it will be ambiguous to use CDMA in those cases. Hence changing it to 3GPP and 3GPP2.",
