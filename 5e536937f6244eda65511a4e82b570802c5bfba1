If we need to change this one, then I think we should change them both; however, I personally like anything that flattens the memory, which this does with no practical drawback.\n\nIf anything, in the future I\u0027d like to move further in the direction of flattening and start making elements like this a \u0027const char[MAX_MCC_MNC_LIST_SIZE][6]\u0027 which is more than sufficient.\n\n\ntl;dr, I\u0027m not in favor of char**",

No backwards compatibility required in P. Given that simplifying assumption, can we just collapse this bad boy in to a single function?",
