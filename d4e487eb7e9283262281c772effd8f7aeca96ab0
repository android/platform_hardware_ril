      "message": "Historically the ril.cpp presented to the FW only the latest version, but things are so different here I decided to have the FW handle the differences. Thus the version is going up to the framework for SETUP_DATA_COMMAND. I\u0027ve uploaded other files which should answer specific questions.\n\nNote; I\u0027ve not yet added support for the new \"_v5\" structures here, in ril.h, to ril.cpp or reference-ril.cpp. But will be doing that this week, I hope.",
