      "message": "It will be nice to have gateway here as well. Currently DHCP returns dns addresses and gateway and DHCP is triggered by RIL. Currently ril just sets a property for gateway and another for dns addresses and JAVA space reads the property to know these values. If you are hoping that the dns addresses will be returned by ril after SETUP_DATA_CALL, it seems logical to have the gateway also returned by this message.",
