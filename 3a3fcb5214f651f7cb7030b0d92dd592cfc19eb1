We are not planing to fine tune the fields based on which apps are running for now. If there is need in the future, we can consider that.\n\nRegarding the signal strength, right now the framework doesn\u0027t configure the threshold, maybe vendor RIL does. If there is need in the future, we can bring them up to the framework layer as NetworkAgent already supported those methods.",
