      "message": "The 3GPP2 standard for RUIM cards specifies multiple user profiles for requesting for different services (like MMS, LBS etc) and each of these have a set of parameters associated with them. The profile ID is a number that uniquely identifies this profile. \n\nThe framework will request for all the profiles for a particular service type (e.g. MMS, LBS etc) and the profile ID\u0027S returned by the modem/UIM-cards has to be saved. When the particular service is requested the profile is chosen from the saved list (arbitrated using priorities if there are multiple profiles).",
