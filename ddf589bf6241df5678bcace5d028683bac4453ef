      "message": "I think how it should work is that - if RIL does return the correct error code then f/w should be able to make use of it to make intelligent decision of whether to retry or not. If it returns a generic failure, (when infact its a permanent failure) then f/w will try again ..only to fail again. So returning the correct failure code might be like an optimization of sort. It may not be guaranteed by every modem and n/w but f/w should handle that somehow.",
